## FAQ
**Q**: *Why python for such a simple tool?*\
**A**: This was first intended to be written in *bash*, however matrix synapse api provides json responses which are easier to handle in python, and python provides compatibility with non unix platforms.

**Q**: *What happens with my authentication token?*\
**A**: I know that entering your matrix  account's authentication token in a random script online is not the best security practice, however the token is never stored on disk nor uploaded anywhere, and is read silently from stdin (check [main.py]())

**Q**: *I did a mistake and accidentally deleted/deactivated a room/user account...*\
**A**: Such actions are permanent actions and cannot be reverted. Please **double check**  before executing any action with this tool. I am not responsible for what goes wrong with it. Also **note that this tool is still heavily untested**, so bugs may occur which can negatively affect your homeserver. If you found any bug, please create an issue and I will try to get it fixed asap.

**Q**: *Is there a CLI alternative to this tool?*\
**A**: I am planning on creating a CLI version in the near future.
